Functionality: 
I couldn't get the code to run, the syntax looked right, and everything about the code looked like it should run and function properly, however I kept receiveing errors, the errors wanted me to correct something that was definitely right, so I'm not sure what was going on. I couldn't find the problem. Upon reviewing the code it looked as if it should function properly if I could've gotten it to run on my computer.

Navigation:
Once again, I couldn't get it to run because of errors that made no sense, however the code looked correct, and I am sure that it would've ran had I been able to get it to compile.

Phone gadget:
The phone gadget was the camera, the code looked like it should've ran, the syntax looked right. The layout was ok, it could've been tabbed which would've made it easier to read, but that doesn't detract from the functionality. 

*I think something may have been wrong with my emulator, the errors it was giving me made no sense, and the code looked exactly the way it should've.
